# The consistency requirements for bind mounts; one of:
#
# - consistent: Full consistency. The container runtime and the host maintain an identical view of the mount at all times.
# - cached:     The host's view of the mount is authoritative. There may be delays before updates made on the host are visible within a container.
# - delegated:  The container runtime's view of the mount is authoritative. There may be delays before updates made in a container are visible on the host.
#
# Note that using 'consistent' can be very slow.
